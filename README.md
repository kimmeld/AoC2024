# Advent of Code 2024

https://adventofcode.com/2024/

I'm doing this year's AoC in Python for ease of use.  I'm not building a fancy framework to run the problems in, just solving each problem in the simplest/easiest way possible.

Each problem consists of three files:
* `dayxx.py` - The Python code to solve that day's problem
* `dayxx.sample` - The sample input from the problem.  This is the same for everyone and is part of the problem description.
* `dayxx.input` - The input data required for the real solution.  This is unique(-ish) for each user and is not included in the repository.
